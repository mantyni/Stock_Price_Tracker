# This is README file for stock API server

## Introduction
### I was frustrated not being able to find simple email notifications about stock prices so I made my own simple script for this.
### Existing stock news apps sometimes fail to notify about important stock movements (think AMC and GME). 
### Additionally, the notificaiton within the app on the phone can easily get lost, missed.   

## Requirements
python 3

## Instructions how to use: 
1. On a high level, there is just main.py and .env file. 
 	To start the server:
	'python3 main.py' Replace variables in .env file: 
	- sender
